## 2.6 Before/After Transformation

### BEFORE (current state):

- **They feel:** Frustrated scrolling through overpriced designer dresses they can't justify buying, or cheap fast-fashion options that look terrible in person
- **They struggle with:** Finding formal wear that's both high-quality AND affordable, dresses that slip down or require constant adjustment, feeling confident in strapless styles
- **They've tried:** Renting designer dresses (expensive, stressful, limited selection), buying fast fashion (disappointing quality, unflattering fit), altering cheaper dresses (still doesn't look right)

### AFTER (with product):

- **They feel:** Confident, elegant, like a million dollars without spending it—excited to wear the dress and show it off
- **They can now:** Walk into any event knowing they're impeccably dressed, dance and move freely without wardrobe anxiety, post photos proudly
- **Others say:** "You look STUNNING! Where is that dress from?" / "Wait, that's not designer?!" / "You're giving main character energy"

## 2.7 The "One Thing" Differentiator

### THE ONE THING:

**Designer-level construction (structured boning, double-lined chiffon, premium tulle) at an accessible price point—without the luxury markup.**

### Why it matters:

Most affordable formal dresses cut corners on construction, leading to slipping, transparency, and cheap-looking results. Most designer dresses with proper construction cost $2,000+. Auralo bridges this gap: you get the stay-put security, opacity, and luxe finish of a designer piece without the four-figure price tag.

### Proof it works:

- Internal grip lining and boning tested for all-night wear
- Double-layer construction = zero transparency
- Premium tulle that photographs beautifully (not stiff or costume-y)
- Flattering on multiple body types due to structured design
- Customers repeatedly ask "Is this designer?!"
