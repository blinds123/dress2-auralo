# RESEARCH-GEARED PROMPTING GUIDE

To ensure the 35 image prompts are of "World Class" quality, the AI must follow these rules when translating Phase 1 Research into Phase 2 Prompts:

### 1. Demographic Matching
*   **If the Dream Customer is "Luxury Lara" (High income, 30s):** The locations in prompts should be "Upscale penthouses", "Private jets", "Luxury spas". Lighting should be "Golden hour" or "High-key studio".
*   **If the Dream Customer is "Rave Roxy" (Gen Z, festivals):** Locations should be "Industrial warehouses", "Neon-lit festivals", "Street style". Lighting should be "Strobe", "Hard flash", or "Cyberpunk neon".

### 2. Objection Crushing (The Bubble Strategy)
Each testimonial and product bubble should directly address one of the Top 6 Objections identified in research.
*   **Objection: "Is it itchy?"** -> Bubble 1: "Is it itchy?" | Bubble 2: "Not at all, the silk lining is literal clouds ☁️"
*   **Objection: "Does it stay up?"** -> Bubble 1: "Will I be pulling this up all night?" | Bubble 2: "Nope! Stayed in place for my whole 4-hour shift 🔥"

### 3. Native Aesthetic
*   The "TikTok-style" reply bubbles must look NATIVE. 
*   Describe them as: "A vertical white rounded-edge comment bubble. On the left, a small circular high-res profile photo. Next to it, a bold username with a small blue checkmark. Below the username, the comment text in clean sans-serif font."
*   Do NOT describe the TikTok logo.

### 4. Image Categories
*   **Product (6):** Professional, aspirational, high-end.
*   **Testimonials (25):** "iPhone Mirror Selfie" style. Realistic, messy backgrounds to increase trust.
*   **Comparison (2):** One "Bad" (Competitor/Walmart style), one "Good" (The high-end product).
*   **Founder/Bump:** Clean, professional commerce photography.
